This repo is a collection of all the projects/homework that I've done while at EWU.

### Repo Notes

Below are the formatting tools used on all of the programs in this repository:

- C/C++ and Java programs have been formatted via [clang-format](https://releases.llvm.org/11.0.1/tools/clang/docs/ClangFormat.html) using the configurations that can be found at both of the following gists: [C/C++](https://gist.github.com/StrangeRanger/2972f774afd20105d3a713677ba92e38) and [Java](https://gist.github.com/StrangeRanger/8f03b433f8ecf3ad425141a56f3f5dcc).
- Python programs have been formated using [black](https://github.com/psf/black). Unlike clang-format, black is highly opinionated, so I have no configuration file for it.
